# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** report a security problem in a public issue, pull request or
forum post.

Report it privately through GitHub instead: open the **Security** tab of this
repository, then **Report a vulnerability**.

No such button? Private reporting is not enabled yet: open an issue that only
asks the maintainers for a private contact, without any detail of the problem,
and send the report there.

Include, when you can:

- the version of the integration and of Gladys;
- what an attacker can do, and the steps to reproduce it;
- the log lines that help (remove tokens, passwords and addresses first).

The fix ships as a new version of the integration, and the advisory is
published once users can update.

## Supported versions

Only the latest release receives security fixes: update the integration from
Gladys before reporting a problem.

## Scope

In scope: the code of this repository and the Docker image it publishes. The
integration stores nothing in `/data`: its configuration (the openHAB address,
the API token or the user name and password) is kept by Gladys and given to the
container at start-up. It only talks to the openHAB server configured, on the
local network, over HTTP or HTTPS; the token and the password are never written
to the logs, and an address holding credentials is refused.

Out of scope: Gladys Assistant itself (see its
[security policy](https://github.com/GladysAssistant/Gladys/security/policy)),
and openHAB and the devices it talks to.
